34,"In the video frame, a man sits on a green sofa, leaning slightly forward with his elbows likely resting on his knees. His head is tilted downwards, and he appears deep in thought, with a serious expression. His lips are pursed and his eyebrows are drawn together, suggesting a moment of contemplation or concern. He's dressed in a casual, gray cardigan over a white shirt, reflecting a relaxed but somewhat somber mood.

Behind him, a window reveals a nighttime cityscape with blurred lights, indicating an urban setting. Curtains drape partially over the window, creating a cozy indoor atmosphere. The space is decorated with a couple of small potted plants on the windowsill, adding a touch of greenery to the otherwise neutral background. The lighting is soft and warm, casting a gentle glow on the man and the surrounding area, which underscores the quiet and introspective mood of the scene."
