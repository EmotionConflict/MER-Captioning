20,"The scene captures a close-up of a woman with long, dark hair sitting or leaning against a wall. Her head is tilted slightly, and she looks upwards with an expression that combines curiosity and concern. Her eyes are wide, and her slightly parted lips suggest she is speaking gently. Soft lighting casts subtle shadows on her face, accentuating her contemplative or concerned look. The background is a plain wall, adding to the intimate focus on her expression. The overall atmosphere seems introspective, with a palpable sense of questioning or empathy conveyed through her eyes and facial demeanor. Subtitles at the bottom show a translated question, adding context to her verbal communication."
