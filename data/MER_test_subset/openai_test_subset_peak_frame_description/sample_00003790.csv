20,"A woman is seated, leaning against a pale wall, her face tilted slightly upward. Her expression is a mix of concern and curiosity, with slightly furrowed brows and parted lips suggesting she's speaking. Her eyes appear wide and reflective, implying a sense of earnestness or urgency. Her dark hair falls loosely around her shoulders, partially framing her face. The lighting is soft but casts shadows, adding to the somber mood of the scene. The background is simple, with no discernible details aside from the wall, focusing attention entirely on her expression and demeanor. Subtle subtitles at the bottom of the frame suggest she is questioning someone about their emotional state."
