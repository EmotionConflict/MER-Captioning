10,"The scene captures a middle-aged woman in mid-conversation, standing slightly turned towards someone off-frame. Her short dark hair frames her face, which is animated with an expression of intensity and seriousness. Her eyebrows are slightly furrowed, and her mouth is open as if she is speaking with conviction. She's dressed in a patterned blouse beneath a dark cardigan, giving off a neat and somewhat formal appearance.

In the background, large windows reveal a soft-focus view of greenery outside, creating a calm yet neutral setting. The light is diffused, suggesting it might be daytime. The body posture of the woman is slightly forward-leaning, emphasizing her engagement and emotional investment in the conversation. Next to her, the shoulder and part of an arm of another person is visible, wearing a light shirt, indicating that she is likely interacting with multiple people. The overall atmosphere suggests a moment of serious discussion."
