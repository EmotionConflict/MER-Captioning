125,"In this scene, a woman is prominently positioned in the foreground, slightly off-center to the right. She is wearing glasses and her hair is styled neatly away from her face. Dressed in a dark hoodie, she faces slightly to the left, possibly engaged in conversation or delivering information thoughtfully. Her expression is attentive and focused, with her mouth slightly open as if she is speaking or reacting to something.

Her surroundings include a workspace that appears orderly and organized. Behind her, a desk is visible, equipped with various items such as colorful books and a couple of pots with pens or small plants, adding a touch of vibrancy to the setting. The overall lighting is soft, contributing to a calm and professional atmosphere. The colors in the background are mostly muted, with hints of brighter elements from the desk items, giving the scene a balanced, uncluttered feel."
