30,"In the video frame, a man wearing a white coat, likely a doctor or a professional, is seated indoors. His head is slightly tilted as he speaks, and his eyes appear focused, suggesting attentiveness or concentration. The expression on his face is neutral to mild, implying he might be engaged in a serious or thoughtful conversation. A stethoscope is draped around his neck, reinforcing the impression of a medical setting. The background shows a desk lamp and some greenery, possibly potted plants, underlining a professional but somewhat comfortable office environment. The lighting is soft, coming from a window with blinds slightly open, casting stripes of light and shadow across the room."
