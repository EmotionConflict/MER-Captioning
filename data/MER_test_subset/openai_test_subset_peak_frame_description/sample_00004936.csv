70,"In the video frame, two women are seated across from each other at a table in what appears to be a casual dining setting. The woman on the left, facing forward, is mid-sentence, her lips parted as if speaking, with a focused expression on her face. Her hair is styled in a neat, side ponytail with some strands gently framing her face. She wears a white top and is leaning slightly forward, suggesting engagement in the conversation.

Opposite her, the back of the second woman's head is visible. She has long, dark hair and wears glasses, which slightly reflect the ambient light. Her posture is attentive, as she leans in slightly towards the other woman, indicating her interest in the discussion.

The background reveals a softly blurred scene with other people in the dining area, seated at tables. The lighting is warm, creating a cozy atmosphere suggestive of a relaxed and friendly interaction."
