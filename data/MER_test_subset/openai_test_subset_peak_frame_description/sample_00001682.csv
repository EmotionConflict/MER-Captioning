10,"A woman is centered in the frame in front of a green chalkboard, partly covered with Chinese characters. She has long, dark hair, pulled back neatly. Her clothing is light-colored, with a collared shirt visible. She faces forward with a subtle, thoughtful expression, eyebrows slightly raised and lips gently pressed together, suggesting contemplation or focus. The chalkboard's presence implies a classroom or educational setting. She holds her posture confidently, indicating she might be teaching or addressing a group. The overall atmosphere is calm and scholarly."
