10,"In this frame, a woman with long, dark hair pulled back is positioned slightly to the right in front of a chalkboard. Her expression is focused with a hint of curiosity or attentiveness, as her eyebrows are slightly raised and she gazes directly ahead. She is wearing a white shirt, suggesting a setting that could be professional or educational. Her body is angled subtly towards the chalkboard, on which there are several characters written in chalk, though they are not clearly readable. The lighting is soft and even, casting no harsh shadows, which emphasizes her calm and composed demeanor. The mood suggests she might be explaining or contemplating something with intent."
