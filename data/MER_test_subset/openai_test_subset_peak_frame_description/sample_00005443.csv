His expression is one of concentration and slight amusement, indicated by his partially raised eyebrows and a faint smile. He wears a light-colored blazer adorned with a dark heart-shaped patch on the lapel, adding a playful or stylish touch to his attire. Underneath, he sports a patterned scarf draped loosely around his neck, contrasting with the lightness of his jacket and adding visual interest.
