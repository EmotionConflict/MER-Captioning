28,"In this video frame, a woman is visible in close-up profile, occupying most of the frame against a subdued background. Her dark hair is mostly pulled back, revealing her expressive face, tilted slightly as if focusing intently on something or someone just beyond the frame. Her eyes are wide and glistening, suggesting a heightened emotional state, possibly concerned or attentive. Her lips are parted, caught mid-sentence, as she appears to be speaking.

A phone is held close to her face, indicating she is engaged in a phone conversation. The device is positioned against her ear on one side. The image is dimly lit, casting soft shadows and emphasizing the contours of her face. The mood is intimate, with a focus on her intensity and concentration as she communicates. Subtitles in a foreign language are at the bottom, hinting at the content or tone of the conversation."
