104,"In the video frame, two people are standing facing each other, both dressed in white lab coats, suggesting a professional or clinical setting. The person on the left, a woman with glasses, has her hair neatly tied back and is looking at the man. Her facial expression appears focused, perhaps attentive or engaged in the conversation. She is wearing a mustard-colored shirt under her lab coat, and a small blue badge is visible on the coat's pocket area.

The man on the right is turned slightly away from the camera, making his face partially obscured from view, but he appears to be listening or speaking to the woman. His stance is relaxed, with no visible tension in his posture. 

Behind them, there are blurred outlines of what might be medical diagrams or charts against a blue wall, indicating the setting could be an office or a laboratory. The overall scene suggests an interaction that could be a discussion or exchange of information, with both individuals engaged in a professional manner."
