104,"The video frame shows two people engaged in a conversation, both dressed in white lab coats, suggesting a professional or medical setting. The person on the left is a woman with her hair neatly tied back, wearing large black-framed glasses. She appears to be speaking, as indicated by her slightly open mouth and focused expression. Her body is angled slightly towards the person on the right, suggesting attention and engagement in the conversation. Beneath her lab coat, a mustard-yellow shirt is visible, adding a touch of color. There is a blue lanyard or badge clip attached to her coat, further indicating a professional environment.

The person on the right is a man, partly visible from the back and side. His body is turned toward the woman, indicating he is listening. His posture is upright, and although his facial expression is not visible, his orientation suggests attentiveness. 

The background features a deep blue wall with some diagrams or charts partially visible, hinting at an academic or scientific setting. There are blurred shapes that might represent equipment or furniture, adding to the impression of a work environment."
