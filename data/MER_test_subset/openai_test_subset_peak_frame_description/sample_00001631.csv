21,"In the video frame, a man is positioned in front of what appears to be a wall of music albums or CDs, suggesting a store or music section. He has short, dark hair styled upward and is wearing a yellow shirt under a gray jacket. His mouth is slightly open, and his eyes are widened, indicating surprise or disbelief. The man is facing towards the left, possibly looking at someone or something not visible in the frame. His stance and expression convey an engaged and possibly reactive interaction. The setting around him is slightly blurred, with the album covers forming a colorful but indistinct background."
