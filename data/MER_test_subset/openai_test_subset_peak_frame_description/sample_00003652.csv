110,"In this frame, a woman with shoulder-length dark hair is prominently featured. Her expression is a mix of concern and slight distress, suggested by her slightly parted lips and the subtle furrowing of her brow. She appears to be speaking, as indicated by her open mouth. Her eyes, wide and glistening in the light, look slightly towards the side of the frame, which may imply she’s engaged in a conversation with someone off-screen. She wears a black top, partially visible beneath an orange garment, which adds a touch of color to the otherwise subdued setting. The background is softly blurred, highlighting her as the focal point. The lighting is gentle, casting a warm tone across her face, which emphasizes the emotional weight of the moment. The word ""妈"" is overlaid on the image, possibly indicating the subject of her attention or conversation."
