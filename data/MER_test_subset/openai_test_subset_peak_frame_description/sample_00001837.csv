16,"In the frame, a young woman is holding a phone to her ear, appearing deeply upset. Her eyes are squinting tightly, and her mouth is slightly open, as if she's speaking or crying. Her brow is furrowed, suggesting distress or worry. Her long hair is pulled back and styled smoothly, with some strands framing her face. She's wearing a soft white top with subtle ruffles, adding a gentle touch to her appearance.

The background is slightly blurred, giving the impression of a bright, indoor setting, perhaps a kitchen or living room, with soft lighting illuminating her face. Her hand holding the phone is slightly raised, pressing the device closely to her ear as if eager to catch every word on the call. Her expression and body language convey a strong sense of urgency and emotional vulnerability."
